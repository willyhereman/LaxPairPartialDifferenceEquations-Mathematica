Dear user, 

The easiest way to get the software is to transfer the 

LPSystemsPartialDifferenceEquationsV2.7z 

to your computer and unzip the files with WinZip or 7zip.

This will create a directory LPSystemsPartialDifferenceEquations with 
subdirectory sampleLattices.  

Alternatively, you can transfer the files 

LPSystemsPartialDifferenceEquations.m 

and 

LPSystemsPartialDifferenceEquations.nb 

to any directory on your computer. Next, under the chosen directory, 
create the subdirectory sampleLattices and put our sample data files in 
that subdirectory. 

Finally, adjust the directory names per instructions given in the 
notebook file LPSystemsPartialDifferenceEquations.nb so that Mathematica 
knows were to find everything.

Please report any problems to 

Willy Hereman: whereman@mines.edu. 

Thank you for using our software, 

Willy Hereman and Terry Bridgman
